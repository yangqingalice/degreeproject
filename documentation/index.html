      <h5>Z Axis</h5>
      <div class="toggle">
        <p>Every physical object has three dimensions, width on the x axis, height on the y axis and thickness on the z axis. A single sheet of flat paper has a z axis that is almost unnoticeable, but when more of them are sequenced together, the z axis makes all the difference. <span>What is the z axis within various forms and media and how it functions?</span></p>
        <p><span>What makes a book a book, instead of a pile of pages? </span></p>
        <p class="indent">Ulises Carrion said in The New Art of Making Books, </p>
        <p class="indent">“A book is a sequence of spaces. Each of these spaces is perceived at a different moment - a book is also a sequence of moments. A book is not a case of words, nor a bag of words, nor a bearer of words.</p>
        <p class="indent">Written language is a sequence of signs expanding within the space; the reading of which occurs in the time. A book is a space-time sequence.”</p>
        <p><span>What happens if the value of z axis is zero? </span></p>
        <p class="indent">In mathematics, the natural number are those used for counting and ordering. Some definitions begin the natural number with 1, not 0. Is 0 in its basis not natural? Does it exists in the natural world of art making? What is a book with 0 page?</p>
        <p><span>What happens if the value of z axis is infinite?</span></p>
        <p class="indent">The physicality of book as a medium almost always gives it a fixed amount of pages. However when we look into the fictional world inside the screens, infinity is everywhere. </p>
        <p>This project starts with the exploration of form, with no specific social purpose. It is, for now, an exploration of pure self-interest. After re-visiting some of my personal favorite projects made in the past two and a half years, I found the study of form, material and media to be the more pleasant field. The result of the project may be socially meaningless and non-functional, which I would enjoy. However there is still possibility if any specific topic comes up that will go with the exploration of z axis.</p>
        <p><span>Some extra thoughts on z axis if it’s defined as a system.</span></p>
        <p class="indent">System is a series of arbitrary decisions.
        <br class="indent">System frees people from making more arbitrary decisions.
        <br class="indent">System is repetition.
        <br class="indent">System is possibility. It generates different results.</p>

      <h5>Z Axis as an Instruction or System/Stone</h5>
      <div class="toggle">
        <p>Sense the stone through touch, smell, taste, hear, sight</p>
        <p>Touch & Hear</p>
        <p  class="indent"><span>What sounds can the stone make through its physical interaction with human hands?</span>
        <br><span>What sounds will it make when it’s tapped, knocked, clicked, gently touched, tickled, etc.?</span>
        <br><span>Which part of the stone is activated?</span>
        <br><span>Which part of the hand is activated?</span></p>
        <p>Stone as a musical instrument</p>
        <br>“Everything we do is music.”—— John Cage
        <p><span>What’s the most appropriate way to represent the sound of the stone, while still keeping its interactive quality?
        <br>How can the meditative quality of the sound be reflected?
        <br>How can the users understand the rules within the instrument without verbal description?</span></p>

      <h5>Interactive Instinct on Web</h5>
      <div class="toggle">
        <p>More thoughts on the updated stone project</p>
        <p  class="indent">Without arbitrary rectangles as keys of the stone instrument, the experience becomes even closer to the real physical experience; however at the same time, the clarity of visual instruction is sacrificed. The initial interaction becomes less instant. User’s natural instinct comes into play and encourages him or her to press on a plain image without any buttons.</p>
        <p><span>How to translate between real physical experience to web interactive experience?</span></p>
        <br><span>What are the instinctive actions people make when browsing?</span></p>
        <p>Interaction with stone vs. Interaction with mouse</p>
        <p class="indent">tap the stone – click
        <br>touch the stone – move
        <br>leave your hand on the stone – hover</p>

        <p><span>How to manipulate user’s instinctive web behavior?</span>
        <br>Scroll, click, hover</p>
        <p><span>What is the default direction of scrolling?</span>
        <br><span>What is the default expectation after a click?</span>
        <br><span>What is the default expectation after hovering?</span></p>
        <p><span>How to counter-act these defaults?</span></p>
        <p><span>How to educate the users step by step?</span></p>
        <p class="indent">No verbal instructions.
        <br>Gradually increase the level of complexity.
        <br>The steps should progress in a way that the knowledge/experience from the previous steps should be reflected in the later ones.
        <br>Progression is a certain amount of similarity plus a little difference.
        <br>When the there’s too much similarity, it's boring; when there’s too much difference, it becomes obscure.</p>

    <h3>Week 5</h3>
    <div class="box">
      <h5>Interaction on mobile devices</h5>
      <div class="toggle">
        <p><span>How is a mobile device different from laptop/desktop in terms of interactive behaviors?</span></p>
        <p>For most laptops/ desktops, mouse, keyboard and track pad are the bridge between users and the screen, and therefore the interactive behaviors are also determined by the technical limit of the computer hardware. Although nowadays companies start to launch laptop/desktop with touch screen, the device is still meant to be used in a fixed position, not to be moved around, because of its size and weight.</p>
        <p>Mobile devices, on the other hand, exploits every possibility from touch screens. However some of the common interactive gestures between mobile devices and laptops/desktops have different default function.</p>
        <p>The followings are some of the built-in functions of laptop/ desktop and mobile device. Here only include the default functions embedded in the operation systems, not a specific application or website.</p>

              <br>a positioning tool, a map, a guide, for a search within a specific area or towards a specific location</p>
            <p>App - Pokemon Go
              <br>GPS (in this case, Google Map) makes it and fails it.
              <br>The game is highly location-based, and location-specific. The foundamental rules of the game perfectly match the Pokemon theme. Google Map provides a sophisticated global map service for Pokémon Go and enables it to realize all the location-based functions. However it was also because of Google, this game becomes unaccessible to potential players in countries where Google service is blocked, like China.
              <br>And once the passion for Pokemons is no longer strong enoguh for people to go out, the game fades away.</p>

            <br>realize that there is always a boundary between the screen and the reality
            <br>even when representing the reality (like the stone project), it was not about mimicing the reality, but translating it
